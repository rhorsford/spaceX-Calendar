 ## Questions
 - Have you worked with API's before? If so, please provide details of relevant projects.
    > I worked at HMRC and used API calls alot in places to get data for a file upload listing system, also file search. 
    These came in the form of ajax requests.
 - How will I approach this task?
    > I firstly setup the gulp stack, after this created my files and went to work on design and the calendar. 
      Then intergrate the api call Use Postman to help sort the url string to make sure I can fetch what I need, lastly touch up and tidy up code.
 - Given more time what would you improve?
    > Would make the calendar dates more interactive, maybe a link to the site, with information on the launches. 
    Would have hooked up browserify. I would also enhance the mobile structure to stack adequetly to display information better.
    also using something like google calander would make intergrations alot easier with apis and less code required.
